## Understanding the problem





# Common Types of Problems



## Palindromes



## Greatest Pair(Adjacent)




## Greatest Pair(Sum/Product)




## Lowest Pair



## Find Something in an Array (Locating a set of numbers etc.)




## String Manipulation 





# Theory based Knowledge




## Big O Notation for particular problems 


* Iterating through a String: O(NlogN)

* A for loop(int i=0; i<n(or any number); i++) with NO division within the header: 
O(N)

* A nested for loop with NO division within the header: O(N^n) n = How many loops there are

* A for loop that contains division (int i=0; i<n/2; i++): O(logN)

* A nested for loop that contains multiple division:  O(logN* O(of the other loops))
