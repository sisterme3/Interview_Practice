## Big O Notation for particular problems 

* Iterating through a String: **O(NlogN)**

* A loop(int i=0; i<n(or any number); i++) with NO division within the header:  **O(N)**

* A nested loop with NO division within the header: **O(N^n) n = How many loops there are**

* A loop that contains division (int i=0; i<n/2; i++): **O(logN)**

* A nested loop that contains multiple division: **O(logN* O(of the other loops))**

* A get, size, length, add, subtract, divide, multiply method (a method with an immediate answer): **O(1) or constant**

### *Remember to take the most dominate term. If the loops are nested, multiply. If the loops are separate, add.*
